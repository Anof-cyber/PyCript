PyCript is a Burp Suite extension that enables users to encrypt and decrypt HTTP requests, responses, and WebSocket messages for manual and automated application penetration testing. It also allows users to create custom encryption and decryption logic using any language like Python, Go, Nodejs, C, Bash etc allowing for a tailored encryption/decryption process for specific needs.
